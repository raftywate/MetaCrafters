* Frontend Code: Review App.js and App.css for the frontend implementation
* Deployment Code: Explore Deploy.js for information on deployment procedures

In this project, I showcase the project I created for the Intermediate Ethereum plus AVAX course. I explain the Solidity contract I built, which includes an owner and a constructor. I also demonstrate the transfer function for transferring funds and the getBalance function for checking the account balance. Additionally, I provide a walkthrough of the frontend part, including the contract address and ABI. Throughout the project, I comment on different sections of the code to provide clarity. No action is requested from the viewers.
